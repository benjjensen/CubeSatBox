# CubeSatBox - Light Demo

Contains code base for a simple light demo for the CubeSat test box.

Currently includes a function to simulate a CubeSat rotating at the center of the Earth (no albedo, no orbit), as well as a simple orbit (including eclipse but no albedo).

Work is being made on an interactive plot that allows you to move the location of the Sun, as well as to integrate with the simulator
